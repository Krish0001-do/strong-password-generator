# 🔐 Strong Password Generator

A futuristic cyberpunk-style strong password generator web app built using Python (Flask), HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It allows users to generate highly secure passwords with customizable options like length, symbols, digits, and uppercase letters.
Users can also manually modify the password and instantly check its strength using an intelligent strength meter.
If the password is weak, the app suggests stronger, smarter alternatives based on AI logic.
It features clipboard support for one-click copy and a neon-glow particle background with typing animations for a modern cyber aesthetic.
Perfect for developers, ethical hackers, and anyone who values strong digital security — in style. ⚡
